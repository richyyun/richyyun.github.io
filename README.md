# Website

I initially had a personal website designed and hosted on Wix that I built near the end of my grad career. I didn't quite have the time to really delve into how to build a website so the drag-and-drop interface kept things easy and fast. 
However, I've definitely noticed a lot of downsides compared to building a website from scratch:
- Inflexible design choices. There were many limitations on design, both in placement of objects, transitions, etc.
- Speed of the site. The site was slow for the small amount of information it had.
- Lack of compatibility. A site designed on Wix cannot be transferred to a different host (or converted to HTML, etc.) as Wix uses it own engine. This was probably the largest point of contention for me.
- High price. It's just plain expensive.

As a result, I decided I wanted to learn basic web development - by basic I mean truly simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After going down the rabbit hole of webhosting (even considering self hosting on the Plex machine) I decided to take things one step at a time and focus on building a site first. The easiest (and free!) way of hosting I found was through (github pages)[https://pages.github.com/].

The website can be found on: [richyyun.github.io](richyyun.github.io)

## TODO
~~1. Figure out implementation of a menu bar.~~
2. Build the homepage.
   ~~- Have the navigation bar drop in on this page~~
   ~~- Would like to make some graphic for this. Currently thinking name, neuroscientist, with a brain image in the middle.~~
   ~~- May delve into blender / rendering an animation with lighting using a 3D model of a brain for this as that would be cool to do.~~
   - In the future may look into threejs to have the light source be where the mouse is and the brain lighting up from different angles.
3. Build the about page.
   - Need to see if I can use a photo from the Sonera website.
   ~~- Photo + box with blurb~~
   ~~- Three circles on the bottom with Sonera logo, UW, Duke. When hovered, the image goes to the right and a short blurb of what I did pops up on the right. Link to respective places.~~
4. Build the research page.
   ~~- Carousel~~
   - Write summaries
5. Build the projects page.
   - Carousel
   - Write summaries
6. Build the CV page.
   - Embedded pdf? 
7. Build the links page.
   ~~- Likely just email, google scholar, linkedin, and github.~~
   - Same animation as about page that reduces opacity of other elements
8. Make things work on mobile / different sized screens.
9. Fine tune colors, design, and animations.
   - Fix favicon - using old one for now
   - Make indicator for naviation bar - javascript to add active class that draws borders


## Lessons learned
1. Asking the right questions.
2. Layout is tough.
   a. When in doubt, wrapper.
