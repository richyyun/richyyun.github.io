                            Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) has been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo. 
                            Previous studies have demonstrated stimulus induced targeted STDP, but they usually required 
                            long conditioning periods and the induced changes were not consistent between different channel 
                            pairs. We hypothesized there were two reasons contributing to the difficulties in inducing STDP: 
                            1. the measure of connectivity is poorly understood, and 2. the timing of stimulation is static o
                            r has low temporal specificity. To test our hypotheses, we applied paired stimulation to the primary 
                            motor cortex of awake primates. Single unit responses to stimulation were used as measures of connectivity, 
                            and we applied inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) from ±0.1 to ±50 ms with sub-millisecond intervals. 
                            The excitatory single unit response resulted in very consistent changes after conditioning that was dependent 
                            on the ISI. Negative ISIs resulted in depression similar to classic STDP, but positive ISI also often resulted 
                            in depression. Normalizing the ISIs to the timing of the excitatory response revealed that potentiation 
                            only occurred if the second stimulus arrived before the response. Stimuli occurring around the time of the 
                            response often resulted in depression as strong as negative ISIs. We additionally tracked the changes in 
                            cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs), a commonly used measure of connectivity in plasticity experiments. 
                            CCEP changes showed a similar but more variable dependence on ISI. These results show that the classic STDP 
                            curve may be more difficult to replicate in vivo due to interactions between excitatory and inhibitory circuitry, 
                            and that CCEPs may not be the ideal measure of changes in strength of connectivity.

                            Objective. The absence of effective therapies for patients with neurological damage necessitates the development of new technologies that 
                            facilitate recovery. One promising new approach is to train artificial neural networks (ANN) to supplement deficient neural circuits by 
                            delivering context-specific intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) that manipulates circuit activity with the intent of restoring lost function. 
                            These ANNs can be described as co-processors to the brain. Here we demonstrate that small artificial spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be 
                            bidirectionally interfaced with single neurons in the primate brain to manipulate their activity. Approach. The activity of single neurons 
                            was recorded from primary motor cortex of two awake non-human primates (NHPs) during rest. The neurons were then interfaced with spiking neural 
                            networks comprised of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons that were programmed on a bidirectional, closed-loop brain-computer interface. Spikes 
                            from the biological neurons sent simulated  excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs or IPSPs) to the artificial IF neurons which 
                            spiked when they reached a predetermined threshold. The spikes of the output IF neurons triggered ICMS to evoke spikes in the biological neurons. 
                            Main results. Interfacing biological neurons with small networks of IF neurons created artificial connections that altered the spiking dynamics 
                            of the biological neurons in predictable ways. We show that these altered dynamics depend on both the architecture of the hybrid network as well 
                            as the timing of stimulation, and that they can be modeled from open-loop measurements. We then used the model to compare and explore how the shape 
                            of the simulated PSPs, inhibition strength, and stimulation delay impact the closed-loop dynamics free from experimental constraints such as 
                            non-stationarities in the brain, experimental run-time, and hardware limitations. Significance. Our results represent one of the first 
                            demonstrations of a neural co-processor that interfaces artificial neurons with biological neurons in the brain.  The closed-loop operation 
                            affected neural activity in vivo in ways predictable from open-loop measures. Our model can be used to probe how different characteristics of 
                            an interfaced SNN modulate closed-loop neural activity, opening the door to developing SNN training algorithms for shaping neuronal activity for 
                            neurorehabilitation.

                            Different sleep stages have been shown to be vital for a variety of brain functions, including learning, memory, 
                            and skill consolidation. However, our understanding of neural dynamics during sleep and the role of prominent LFP 
                            frequency bands remain incomplete. To elucidate such dynamics and differences between behavioral states we collected 
                            multichannel LFP and spike data in primary motor cortex of unconstrained macaques for up to 24 h using a head-fixed 
                            brain-computer interface (Neurochip3). Each 8-s bin of time was classified into awake-moving (Move), awake-resting 
                            (Rest), REM sleep (REM), or non-REM sleep (NREM) by using dimensionality reduction and clustering on the average 
                            spectral density and the acceleration of the head. LFP power showed high delta during NREM, high theta during REM, 
                            and high beta when the animal was awake. Cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling typically showed higher coupling 
                            during NREM between all pairs of frequency bands. Two notable exceptions were high delta-high gamma and theta-high 
                            gamma coupling during Move, and high theta-beta coupling during REM. Single units showed decreased firing rate during 
                            NREM, though with increased short ISIs compared to other states. Spike-LFP synchrony showed high delta synchrony during 
                            Move, and higher coupling with all other frequency bands during NREM. These results altogether reveal potential 
                            roles and functions of different LFP bands that have previously been unexplored.

                            Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is commonly used in many experimental and clinical paradigms; however, 
                            its effects on the activation of neurons are still not completely understood. To document the responses of 
                            cortical neurons in awake nonhuman primates to stimulation, we recorded single-unit activity while delivering 
                            single-pulse stimulation via Utah arrays implanted in primary motor cortex (M1) of three macaque monkeys. 
                            Stimuli between 5 and 50 μA delivered to single channels reliably evoked spikes in neurons recorded throughout 
                            the array with delays of up to 12 ms. ICMS pulses also induced a period of inhibition lasting up to 150 ms that 
                            typically followed the initial excitatory response. Higher current amplitudes led to a greater probability 
                            of evoking a spike and extended the duration of inhibition. The likelihood of evoking a spike in a neuron was 
                            dependent on the spontaneous firing rate as well as the delay between its most recent spike time and stimulus 
                            onset. Tonic repetitive stimulation between 2 and 20 Hz often modulated both the probability of evoking spikes 
                            and the duration of inhibition; high-frequency stimulation was more likely to change both responses. On a 
                            trial-by-trial basis, whether a stimulus evoked a spike did not affect the subsequent inhibitory response; 
                            however, their changes over time were often positively or negatively correlated. Our results document the 
                            complex dynamics of cortical neural responses to electrical stimulation that need to be considered when using 
                            ICMS for scientific and clinical applications.

                            One of the most promising applications of neuroprosthetics is clinical rehabilitation. Stimulation techniques to induce 
                            plasticity and aid in the recovery of motor function following neurological damage from stroke or spinal cord injury have 
                            previously been implemented with varying degrees of success. To develop a more effective approach, we need a better 
                            understanding of how stimulation delivered during voluntary movements affects motor function. Although communication between 
                            the motor cortices of the two hemispheres is essential for coordinated behavior even during unilateral movements, previous 
                            studies that investigated the effects of delivering stimulation during movement typically focused on a single hemisphere and 
                            the contralateral limb. On the other hand, studies exploring the interplay between the two hemispheres typically delivered 
                            stimulation at rest. This study aims to bridge these approaches by comprehensively probing the effects of delivering stimulation 
                            to one motor cortex during different phases of voluntary contralateral or ipsilateral unimanual movement. 
                            <!--
                            Cortical stimulation (CS) of the motor cortex can cause excitability changes in both hemispheres, showing potential 
                            to be a technique for clinical rehabilitation of motor function. However, previous studies that have investigated 
                            the effects of delivering CS during movement typically focus on a single hemisphere. On the other hand, studies exploring 
                            interhemispheric interactions typically deliver CS at rest. We sought to bridge these two approaches by documenting the 
                            consequences of delivering CS to a single motor cortex during different phases of contralateral and ipsilateral 
                            limb movement, and simultaneously assessing changes in interactions within and between the hemispheres via local field 
                            potential (LFP) recordings. Three macaques were trained in a unimanual reaction time (RT) task and implanted with epidural 
                            or intracortical electrodes over bilateral motor cortices. During a given session CS was delivered to one hemisphere with 
                            respect to movements of either the contralateral or ipsilateral limb. Stimulation delivered before contralateral limb 
                            movement onset shortened the contralateral limb RT. In contrast, stimulation delivered after the end of contralateral 
                            movement increased contralateral RT but decreased ipsilateral RT. Stimulation delivered before ipsilateral limb movement 
                            decreased ipsilateral RT. All other stimulus conditions as well as random stimulation and periodic stimulation did not have 
                            consistently significant effects on either limb. Simultaneous LFP recordings from one animal revealed correlations between 
                            changes in interhemispheric alpha band coherence and changes in RT, suggesting that alpha activity may be indicative of 
                            interhemispheric communication. These results show that changes caused by CS to the functional coupling within and between 
                            precentral cortices is contingent on the timing of CS relative to movement.

                            Understanding the potential for plasticity in the adult brain is a key goal for basic neuroscience and modern rehabilitative medicine. 
                            This study examines one dimension of this challenge: how malleable is sensory processing in adult mammals? We implemented a panoramic 
                            infrared (IR) sensory prosthetic system in rats; it consisted of four IR sensors equally spaced around the circumference of the head 
                            of the rat. Each sensor was coupled to a microstimulating electrode placed in the somatosensory cortex of the rat. Within days, rats 
                            learned to use the prosthesis to track down items associated with IR light in their environment. This is quite promising clinically, as 
                            the largest demand for sensory prosthetic devices is in adults whose brains are already fully developed.
                            <!--
                            Can the adult brain assimilate a novel, topographically organized, sensory modality into its perceptual repertoire? To test this, 
                            we implemented a microstimulation-based neuroprosthesis that rats used to discriminate among infrared (IR) light sources. This 
                            system continuously relayed information from four IR sensors that were distributed to provide a panoramic view of IR sources, 
                            into primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Rats learned to discriminate the location of IR sources in <4 d. Animals in which IR 
                            information was delivered in spatial register with whisker topography learned the task more quickly. Further, in animals that 
                            had learned to use the prosthesis, altering the topographic mapping from IR sensor to stimulating electrode had immediate deleterious 
                            effects on discrimination performance. Multielectrode recordings revealed that S1 neurons had multimodal (tactile/IR) receptive fields, 
                            with clear preferences for those stimuli most likely to be delivered during the task. Neuronal populations predicted, with high accuracy, 
                            which stimulation pattern was present in small (75 ms) time windows. Surprisingly, when identical microstimulation patterns were delivered 
                            during an unrelated task, cortical activity in S1 was strongly suppressed. Overall, these results show that the adult mammalian 
                            neocortex can readily absorb completely new information sources into its representational repertoire, and use this information in 
                            the production of adaptive behaviors.
