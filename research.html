                            Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) has been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo. 
                            Previous studies have demonstrated stimulus induced targeted STDP, but they usually required 
                            long conditioning periods and the induced changes were not consistent between different channel 
                            pairs. We hypothesized there were two reasons contributing to the difficulties in inducing STDP: 
                            1. the measure of connectivity is poorly understood, and 2. the timing of stimulation is static o
                            r has low temporal specificity. To test our hypotheses, we applied paired stimulation to the primary 
                            motor cortex of awake primates. Single unit responses to stimulation were used as measures of connectivity, 
                            and we applied inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) from ±0.1 to ±50 ms with sub-millisecond intervals. 
                            The excitatory single unit response resulted in very consistent changes after conditioning that was dependent 
                            on the ISI. Negative ISIs resulted in depression similar to classic STDP, but positive ISI also often resulted 
                            in depression. Normalizing the ISIs to the timing of the excitatory response revealed that potentiation 
                            only occurred if the second stimulus arrived before the response. Stimuli occurring around the time of the 
                            response often resulted in depression as strong as negative ISIs. We additionally tracked the changes in 
                            cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs), a commonly used measure of connectivity in plasticity experiments. 
                            CCEP changes showed a similar but more variable dependence on ISI. These results show that the classic STDP 
                            curve may be more difficult to replicate in vivo due to interactions between excitatory and inhibitory circuitry, 
                            and that CCEPs may not be the ideal measure of changes in strength of connectivity.

                            Objective. The absence of effective therapies for patients with neurological damage necessitates the development of new technologies that 
                            facilitate recovery. One promising new approach is to train artificial neural networks (ANN) to supplement deficient neural circuits by 
                            delivering context-specific intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) that manipulates circuit activity with the intent of restoring lost function. 
                            These ANNs can be described as co-processors to the brain. Here we demonstrate that small artificial spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be 
                            bidirectionally interfaced with single neurons in the primate brain to manipulate their activity. Approach. The activity of single neurons 
                            was recorded from primary motor cortex of two awake non-human primates (NHPs) during rest. The neurons were then interfaced with spiking neural 
                            networks comprised of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons that were programmed on a bidirectional, closed-loop brain-computer interface. Spikes 
                            from the biological neurons sent simulated  excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs or IPSPs) to the artificial IF neurons which 
                            spiked when they reached a predetermined threshold. The spikes of the output IF neurons triggered ICMS to evoke spikes in the biological neurons. 
                            Main results. Interfacing biological neurons with small networks of IF neurons created artificial connections that altered the spiking dynamics 
                            of the biological neurons in predictable ways. We show that these altered dynamics depend on both the architecture of the hybrid network as well 
                            as the timing of stimulation, and that they can be modeled from open-loop measurements. We then used the model to compare and explore how the shape 
                            of the simulated PSPs, inhibition strength, and stimulation delay impact the closed-loop dynamics free from experimental constraints such as 
                            non-stationarities in the brain, experimental run-time, and hardware limitations. Significance. Our results represent one of the first 
                            demonstrations of a neural co-processor that interfaces artificial neurons with biological neurons in the brain.  The closed-loop operation 
                            affected neural activity in vivo in ways predictable from open-loop measures. Our model can be used to probe how different characteristics of 
                            an interfaced SNN modulate closed-loop neural activity, opening the door to developing SNN training algorithms for shaping neuronal activity for 
                            neurorehabilitation.

                            Different sleep stages have been shown to be vital for a variety of brain functions, including learning, memory, 
                            and skill consolidation. However, our understanding of neural dynamics during sleep and the role of prominent LFP 
                            frequency bands remain incomplete. To elucidate such dynamics and differences between behavioral states we collected 
                            multichannel LFP and spike data in primary motor cortex of unconstrained macaques for up to 24 h using a head-fixed 
                            brain-computer interface (Neurochip3). Each 8-s bin of time was classified into awake-moving (Move), awake-resting 
                            (Rest), REM sleep (REM), or non-REM sleep (NREM) by using dimensionality reduction and clustering on the average 
                            spectral density and the acceleration of the head. LFP power showed high delta during NREM, high theta during REM, 
                            and high beta when the animal was awake. Cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling typically showed higher coupling 
                            during NREM between all pairs of frequency bands. Two notable exceptions were high delta-high gamma and theta-high 
                            gamma coupling during Move, and high theta-beta coupling during REM. Single units showed decreased firing rate during 
                            NREM, though with increased short ISIs compared to other states. Spike-LFP synchrony showed high delta synchrony during 
                            Move, and higher coupling with all other frequency bands during NREM. These results altogether reveal potential 
                            roles and functions of different LFP bands that have previously been unexplored.
