                            Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) has been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo. 
                            Previous studies have demonstrated stimulus induced targeted STDP, but they usually required 
                            long conditioning periods and the induced changes were not consistent between different channel 
                            pairs. We hypothesized there were two reasons contributing to the difficulties in inducing STDP: 
                            1. the measure of connectivity is poorly understood, and 2. the timing of stimulation is static o
                            r has low temporal specificity. To test our hypotheses, we applied paired stimulation to the primary 
                            motor cortex of awake primates. Single unit responses to stimulation were used as measures of connectivity, 
                            and we applied inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) from ±0.1 to ±50 ms with sub-millisecond intervals. 
                            The excitatory single unit response resulted in very consistent changes after conditioning that was dependent 
                            on the ISI. Negative ISIs resulted in depression similar to classic STDP, but positive ISI also often resulted 
                            in depression. Normalizing the ISIs to the timing of the excitatory response revealed that potentiation 
                            only occurred if the second stimulus arrived before the response. Stimuli occurring around the time of the 
                            response often resulted in depression as strong as negative ISIs. We additionally tracked the changes in 
                            cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs), a commonly used measure of connectivity in plasticity experiments. 
                            CCEP changes showed a similar but more variable dependence on ISI. These results show that the classic STDP 
                            curve may be more difficult to replicate in vivo due to interactions between excitatory and inhibitory circuitry, 
                            and that CCEPs may not be the ideal measure of changes in strength of connectivity.
